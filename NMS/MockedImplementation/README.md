# Mocked implementation of NMS Wrappers

**This module is only meant to be used for testing UltimateAdvancementAPI.**

This module contains a mocked implementation of the wrappers defined into the [NMS/Common module](../Common).  
This module is *not* distributed inside the [NMS/Distribution module](../Distribution), so that it'll be not included into the final artifact(s) of UltimateAdvancementAPI.

> The mocked server version is `mocked0_0_R1`. The version number (`mocked0_0_R1`) has no particular meaning since the mocked implementation is version-independent.  
> See [`VersionedServerMock`](../../Common/src/test/java/org/bukkit/craftbukkit/mocked0_0_R1/VersionedServerMock.java) for more information.
